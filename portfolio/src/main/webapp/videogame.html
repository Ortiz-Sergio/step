    <!--A section on my favorite videogames!-->
    <h2 style="color:FloralWhite; background-color:red;">My Favorite Videogames:</h2>
    <p>
        Here are some of my favorite videogames. There's a lot but these are the ones 
        I could think of when writing this!
    </p>

    <img src="/images/videogames/botw.jpg" alt ="Breath of the Wild" 
    class="center" align="left" />
    <p>
        Easily my favorite videogame of all time is The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
        This adventure was so massive and epic, it's honestly hard to forget. I have now
        played this game twice, sinking in almost 500 hours into it! I could have easily 
        spent that time on a sophisticated personal project.  
    </p>

    <img src="/images/videogames/cuphead.png" alt ="Cuphead" display="block" margin-left="auto"
    margin-right="auto" width="15%" height="15%" align="right" />
    <p>
        Another personal favorite is Cuphead. This game was so challenging, but the feeling 
        of personal accomplishment upon passing a level is unmatched. The artsyle of this game
        is so unique and fun, with every character and animation hand-drawn to represent old 
        cartoons. I cannot wait for the upcoming DLC!
    </p>

    <!--This mess here is trying to put text in between two images-->
    <img src="/images/videogames/super_mario3d.jpg" alt ="Super Mario 3D World" display="block" 
    margin-left="auto" margin-right="auto" width="30%" height="30%" align="left" />
    <img src="/images/videogames/dk1.jpeg" alt ="Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze" display="block" 
    margin-left="auto" margin-right="auto" width="25%" height="25%" align="right" />
    <div>
    <p>
        These are some of my favorite platformers! Although Super Mario 3D World is not 
        commonly liked by fans, it is my favorite 3D platformer simply because it was 
        the first brand new game that I bought on release. Tropical Freeze is probably one
        of the best 2D platformers ever.
