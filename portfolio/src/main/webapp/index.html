      <!--About Me Section, how I got into Computer Science-->
      <h2 style="color:FloralWhite; background-color:red;">About Me:</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Sergio Ortiz. My passions include coding and playing videogames! I also like solving 
          twisty puzzles such as the Rubik's cube, with my average solve time on the 3x3 lying at slightly 
          under 35 seconds! My favorite language is Java, with Python coming in close second!

      class="center" align="left" />
       I was born in February 11, 2001 in the border city of El Paso, Texas. As a child, I was always 
       gifted in Mathematics. One of my earliest memories of school is impressing my first grade teacher 
       by doing division (pretty sure it was division by 2). During my early teenage years, I was in a bit 
       of a slump in regards to my career choice. I knew engineering would probably utilize my strenghts 
       the most, but I was unsure what branch to pursue. Then, as a sophmore in High School, I got the 
       opportunity to take the introductory Computer Science course at my local community college. After the 
       first week of this class, I was 90% sure I had finally found my career interest and thus, began the journey!
       Four years later, I am a STEP intern at Google!

    <!--A section on my favorite videogames!-->
    <h2 style="color:FloralWhite; background-color:red;">My Favorite Videogames:</h2>
    <p>Here are some of my favorite videogames. There's a lot but these are the ones 
        I could think of when writing this!</p>

    <img src="/images/videogames/botw.jpg" alt ="Breath of the Wild" 
      class="center" align="left" />
      <p>Easily my favorite videogame of all time is The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
          This adventure was so massive and epic, it's honestly hard to forget. I have now
          played this game twice, sinking in almost 500 hours into it! I could have easily 
          spent that time on a sophisticated personal project.  </p>

    <br>
    <img src="/images/videogames/cuphead.png" alt ="Cuphead" display="block" margin-left="auto"
    margin-right="auto" width="15%" height="15%" align="right" />
      <p>Another personal favorite is Cuphead. This game was so challenging, but the feeling 
          of personal accomplishment upon passing a level is unmatched. The artsyle of this game
          is so unique and fun, with every character and animation hand-drawn to represent old 
          cartoons. I cannot wait for the upcoming DLC! </p>

    <br>
    <!--This mess here is trying to put text in between two images-->
    <img src="/images/videogames/super_mario3d.jpg" alt ="Super Mario 3D World" display="block" 
    margin-left="auto" margin-right="auto" width="30%" height="30%" align="left" />
    <img src="/images/videogames/dk1.jpeg" alt ="Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze" display="block" 
    margin-left="auto" margin-right="auto" width="25%" height="25%" align="right" />
        <p>These are some of my favorite platformers! Although Super Mario 3D World is not 
            commonly liked by fans, it is my favorite 3D platformer simply because it was 
            the first brand new game that I bought on release. Tropical Freeze is probably one
            of the best 2D platformers ever. </p>
