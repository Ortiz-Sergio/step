      <h2 style="color:FloralWhite; background-color:red;">About Me:</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Sergio Ortiz. My passions include coding and playing videogames! I also like solving 
          twisty puzzles such as the Rubik's cube, with my average solve time with the 3x3 lying at slightly 
          under 35 seconds! My favorite language is Java, with Python coming in close second!

       I was born in February 11, 2001 in the border city of El Paso, Texas. As a child, I was always 
       gifted in Mathematics. One of my earliest memories of school is impressing my first grade teacher 
       by doing division (pretty sure it was division by 2). During my early teenage years, I was in a bit 
       of a slump in regards to my career choice. I knew engineering would probably utilize my strenghts 
       the most, but I was unsure what branch to pursue. Then, as a sophmore in High School, I got the 
       opportunity to take the introductory Computer Science course at my local community college. After the 
       first week of this class, I was 90% sure I had finally found my career interest and thus, began the journey!
       Four years later, I am a STEP intern at Google!

      <h2 style="color:FloralWhite; background-color:green;">Twisty Puzzles!</h2>
      <p>
          As I mentioned in the beginning of this webiste, one of my favorite hobbies is solving twisty puzzles!
          Below is a slideshow of some of my favorite puzzles!
      </p>

      <script>
          var i = 0;
          var images = [];
          var time = 2000;

          images[0] = '/images/flags/american_flag.png';
          images[1] = '/images/flags/bandera_mexicana.png';

          function slideshow() {
              document.slide.src = images[i];
              if (i < images.length - 1) {
                  i++;
              } else {
                  i = 0;
              }
              setTimeout("slideshow()", time);
          }

          window.onload = slideshow;
      </script>
